        <h2>Lore</h2>
        <p>
          According to Wikipedia, RDR2 is set in a fictionalized United States in 1899 during the decline of the Wild West.
          The main narrative follows Arthur Morgan and the Van der Linde gang as they try to survive pressure from law enforcement, rival gangs, and a rapidly modernizing world.
        </p>
        <p>
          It serves as a prequel to the original Red Dead Redemption and focuses heavily on loyalty, survival, and the collapse of the outlaw lifestyle.

        <h2>Narrative Depth</h2>
        <p>
          The story is framed around Arthur Morgan's loyalty to the Van der Linde gang while the old frontier era collapses.
          Wikipedia highlights how the game ties personal relationships and moral choices to the broader decline of the outlaw myth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because this is a prequel, many moments gain extra weight for players who know where the original Red Dead Redemption eventually leads.
