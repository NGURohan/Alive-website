        <h2>Lore</h2>
        <p>
          Wikipedia describes Valorant as being set in the near future, where players take control of Agents from different countries and cultures.
          The lore framework supports the idea of specialized operatives with distinct powers and identities.
        </p>
        <p>
          In match context, the core fantasy is a coordinated strike/defense scenario: one team attacks sites and plants the Spike, the other team holds and retakes.

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>5v5 tactical rounds with economy management for weapons and abilities.</li>
          <li>Agents are split into classes (Duelists, Initiators, Controllers, Sentinels), each shaping team strategy.</li>
          <li>Gunplay rewards positioning and precision while abilities create utility, space, and counterplay.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Match Structure</h2>
        <p>
          A standard match loop revolves around attackers versus defenders, objective control, and economy decisions between rounds.
          This creates a tactical rhythm where adaptation matters as much as mechanical aim.
        </p>
        <p>
          Team composition and utility timing are major strategic layers, so communication and role discipline heavily impact outcomes.
